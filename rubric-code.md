# Rubric for marking a coding assignment

This rubric is for a Jupyter notebook containing code that performs a specified
task. The notebook should contain comments/markdown explaining the logic and
methods used.

If your notebooks contains a data analysis part as well, use the
[`rubric-notebook.md`](rubric-notebook.md) instead.

      <td>Code runs correctly and there is enough properly formatted documentation but code is awkward, inefficient, or uses a limited range of features</td>
      <td>Code runs correctly, has appropriate documentation, and appropriately uses a range of skills presented in class (functions, string formatting, etc)</td>

      <td>Some deficiencies in style, adequate but not optimal, may require better layout, length, style of figures/tables, or use of headings</td>
      <td>Logical presentation, appropriate length, but still requires some re-organising or editing</td>
