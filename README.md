# Marking rubrics

Marking rubrics for reports, coding assignments, and Jupyter notebooks based on
the UK marking scheme.
Adapted from the marking rubrics used by the
[School of Environmental Sciences, University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/environmental-sciences/).

Rubrics are HTML tables so they can be easily used and adapted within Canvas,
GitHub, and other virtual learning platforms.
